# Abstract

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify apple leaves into four categories: healthy, rust, scab, or multiple diseases. The model is trained on a dataset of 3,000 images of apple leaves, each labeled with one of the four classes. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with transfer learning from a pre-trained ResNet-50 model. The model achieves an accuracy of 87.5% on the test set, which consists of 1,000 images of apple leaves. The model can be used as a tool for apple farmers and researchers to diagnose and prevent apple diseases, as well as to reduce the use of pesticides and chemicals. The project also includes a web application that allows users to upload their own images of apple leaves and get the model’s prediction. The web application is built using Flask and deployed on Heroku. The project demonstrates the potential of image classification for agricultural applications.
