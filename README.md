# Abstract

When presented with a grayscale photo, this study addresses the challenge of generating a believable color rendition of the image. Given the inherent lack of constraints in this task, prior methods often required substantial user input or yielded desaturated outcomes. Our innovative solution adopts a fully automated approach, delivering vivid and lifelike colorizations. Acknowledging the inherent uncertainties, we treat the problem as a classification task, employing class-rebalancing during training to enhance color diversity. The system operates as a feed-forward pass in a CNN during testing, trained on a vast dataset of over a million color images. Evaluation through a "colorization Turing test" reveals a 32% success rate in deceiving human observers, surpassing previous techniques. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of colorization as a potent pretext task for self-supervised feature learning, showcasing superior performance in various feature learning benchmarks.
