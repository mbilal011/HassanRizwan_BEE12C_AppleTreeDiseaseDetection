# Abstract

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify apple leaves into four categories: healthy, rust, scab, or multiple diseases. The model is trained on a dataset of 3,000 images of apple leaves, each labeled with one of the four classes. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with transfer learning from a pre-trained ResNet-50 model. The model can be used as a tool for apple farmers and researchers to diagnose and prevent apple diseases, as well as to reduce the use of pesticides and chemicals. The project demonstrates the potential of image classification for agricultural applications.
